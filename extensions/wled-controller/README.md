4. Enable "Test Connection" to verify the device is reachable
5. Select your device to start controlling it!

## Finding Your WLED Device IP

**Router Admin Panel** - Look for "WLED" in your connected devices list

**Device Display** - If your device has a display, the IP may be shown there

**Try Common URLs:**
- `http://wled.local`
- `http://192.168.1.X` (try common addresses)

**Network Scan** - Use tools like Angry IP Scanner or nmap:
```bash
nmap -p 80 192.168.1.0/24
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Cmd+N` - Add new device
- `Cmd+Backspace` - Delete device
- `Cmd+1` - Set 100% brightness
- `Cmd+2` - Set 75% brightness
- `Cmd+3` - Set 50% brightness
- `Cmd+4` - Set 25% brightness

## Color Options

**Presets** - 12 pre-configured colors including White, Red, Green, Blue, Orange, Purple, and more

**Custom Color Picker** - RGB sliders (0-255) with real-time hex preview and two-way synchronization

**Hex Input** - Enter any hex color code directly (e.g., #FF5500)

## Requirements

- WLED device(s) on your local network
- Device IP address (see "Finding Your WLED Device IP" above)


## Troubleshooting

**Connection Test Fails**
- Ensure device is powered on and on the same network as your Mac
- Verify the IP address is correct
- Check that no VPN is blocking local network access
- Test manually: `curl http://192.168.1.100/json`

**Device Won't Control**
- Click "Refresh" in the control panel
- Verify device is still online
- Check if IP address changed (consider using static IPs)

## Tips

- Set DHCP reservations for your WLED devices to maintain consistent IP addresses
- Always enable "Test Connection" when adding devices
- Use keyboard shortcuts (`Cmd+1` through `Cmd+4`) for quick brightness control
- The custom color picker remembers your last used color
