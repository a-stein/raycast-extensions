## Overview

Fetch YouTube Transcript is a Raycast extension that allows you to easily fetch and save transcripts from YouTube videos.

## Features

## ⚠️ Important Prerequisite: `yt-dlp` Installation

This extension has been updated to use `yt-dlp`, a powerful and reliable command-line tool for interacting with YouTube. This change was made because previous methods were becoming unreliable due to frequent changes by YouTube.

```bash
pip install yt-dlp
```

Or

```bash
brew install yt-dlp
```

Or, refer to the official `yt-dlp` documentation for other installation methods: [https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installation](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installation)
