### 2.0.1 Breaking Changes

- Switched the core transcript fetching mechanism from JavaScript libraries to the external `yt-dlp` command-line tool. Users are now required to install `yt-dlp` for the extension to function.

### 2.0.1 Added

- Added `@raycast/utils` as a dependency for improved UI components.

### 2.0.1 Fixed
